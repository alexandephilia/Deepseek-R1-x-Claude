# 🧠 DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Executor

A powerful cognitive architecture that combines DeepSeek R1 as the primary reasoning planner with Claude as the execution engine. In this system:

- **DeepSeek R1 (The Brain)** acts as the advanced reasoning planner:
  - Plans multi-step logical analysis strategies
  - Structures cognitive frameworks
  - Evaluates confidence and uncertainty
  - Monitors reasoning quality
  - Detects edge cases and biases

- **Claude (The Executor)** implements the reasoning plans:
  - Executes the structured analysis
  - Implements planned strategies
  - Delivers final responses
  - Handles user interaction
  - Manages system integration

This planner-executor architecture leverages:
- Large-scale reinforcement learning that naturally emerges complex reasoning patterns
- Multi-step logical analysis with structured cognitive frameworks
- Real-time streaming of reasoning processes with confidence metrics
- Systematic decomposition of problems into analyzable components
- Robust error detection and metacognitive monitoring

The server acts as a cognitive bridge, using DeepSeek R1's specialized reasoning architecture to plan complex analytical strategies that Claude then executes with precision.
